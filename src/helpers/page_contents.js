The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet. XcelPay Wallet CANNOT Assist with Password Retrieval. XcelPay Wallet stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password. Virtual Currency Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the ‘blockchain networks supported by us’ and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using XcelPay Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the ‘blockchain networks supported by us’. XcelPay Wallet Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the ‘blockchain networks supported by us’ and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that XcelPay Wallet can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete.

You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet.Payment and Fees: XcelPay Wallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies.Transactions: Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction.
